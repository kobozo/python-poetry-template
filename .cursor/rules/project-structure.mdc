Key requirements:
1. All source code lives under `src/project_name`
2. Tests mirror source structure in `tests/` directory
3. Poetry manages dependencies in `pyproject.toml`
4. Pytest configuration in root `pytest.ini`
5. Environment configuration in `.env` files
6. Never update the `pyproject.toml` yourself for addind dependencies but use `poetry add {dependency}`

Tests must:
- Be placed in `tests/` directory
- Follow `test_*.py` naming convention
- An example of an import from the source code: `from project_name.main import demo_function`
- Use pytest framework with coverage
